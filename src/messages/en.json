      "p2": "Our Bilingual Project develops and builds from the earliest years of life, with a strong emphasis on correct pronunciation.",
      "p3": "From a very young age, our children come into contact with their second language, responding to their communication and interaction needs. In this way, they learn to study, carry out activities, and “live” in English, graduating with knowledge and familiarity in the language that allows them to integrate comfortably into different English-speaking academic and work environments.",
      "p4": "For this, the integrated curriculum plan in English and Spanish includes the corresponding International Certifications.",
      "p5": "We work to facilitate and ensure the construction of a solid bond with the second language and foster confidence in students regarding their ability to learn it.",

      "p2": "According to UNESCO documentation, in numerous international experiences, it is shown that teaching two or more languages reinforces other learning, especially the mother tongue (in both formative and instrumental aspects), and represents significant linguistic, cognitive, and socio-cultural benefits for students.",
      "p3": "On the socio-cultural level, the benefit lies in the fact that knowing other languages allows people not only to expand their scope of action by communicating with members of other cultures but also to understand and value different customs and worldviews, thereby living with diversity.",
      "p4": "Regarding how to access learning other languages, research shows that students’ learning is more meaningful and therefore longer-lasting when the language is used as a vehicle for learning other content and not only as an object of study in itself. Hence our Bilingual Educational Project proposal. Thus, bridges are built between the teaching of English and the rest of the curriculum areas: linguistic content is taught, and simultaneously, disciplinary content is approached."

        "p4": "Some benefits of play in children include its contribution to psychomotor, cognitive, social, and affective-moral development. Through play, they gain experiences about themselves and the world around them, rehearse adult roles and behaviors, train skills, practice routines and sequences of behavior that will be useful throughout their lives. They test their knowledge, learn the relevance of playing in groups, and learn to tolerate others’ viewpoints. Additionally, it helps strengthen affective bonds. The foundation and engine of all deep learning is this bond, which allows creating and strengthening trust."
